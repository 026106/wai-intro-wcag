## Background: WCAG and Supplemental Guidance

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provides requirements for making websites, applications, and other digital content accessible to people with disabilities. It is introduced in the [WCAG 2 Overview {% include_cached icon.html name="different-view" %}](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

There are additional resources that help you understand and implement WCAG. They are explained in the [WCAG 2 Documents {% include_cached icon.html name="different-view" %}](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/docs/).

Some accessibility issues did not fit as WCAG 2 requirements (called "success criteria"). This **_supplemental guidance_** provides advice on addressing many of those accessibility issues.

Following this guidance is **not required to meet WCAG**. And, we encourage you to follow this guidance in order meet more user needs.

The accessibility issues addressed in this guidance are essential for people with certain disabilities to be able to use digital technology.
