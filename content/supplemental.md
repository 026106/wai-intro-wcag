## Background: WCAG and Supplemental Guidance

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provides requirements for making websites, applications, and other digital content accessible to people with disabilities. It is introduced in the [WCAG 2 Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

There are additional resources that help you understand and implement WCAG. They are explained in the [WCAG 2 Documents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/docs/).

Some accessibility issues did not fit as WCAG 2 requirements (called "success criteria"). **_Supplemental guidance_** provides advice on addressing many of those accessibility issues.

Following the supplemental guidance is **not required to meet WCAG**. And, we encourage you to follow this guidance in order meet more user needs.

The accessibility issues addressed in the supplemental guidance are essential for people with certain disabilities to be able to use digital technology.

## Accessibility for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities

For starters, see **[[Cognitive Accessibility at W3C]](WAI/cognitive/)**. It introduces:
* accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities (“cognitive accessibility”)
* existing standards from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)
* informative guidance beyond the standards
* on-going work on cognitive accessibility support at W3C WAI

The supplemental guidance covers improving accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. Later in March 2022, you can access that guidance from this web address (URI [www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental](/WCAG2/supplemental/)).

For now, you can find a large amount of information in: **[Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities {% include_cached icon.html name="different-view" %}](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/)**.

The supplemental guidance will be a sub-set of that information. It will include the "Objectives" and "Design Patterns".
