## Introduction {#intro}

The W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3 Working Draft is **different** from previous versions. It has:
* different structure
* different conformance model
* broader scope, beyond just web content

WCAG 3 is **similar** to previous versions in some ways. It has:
* the same goal of providing guidance on making technology accessible to people with disabilities
* similar fundamental and specific accessibility requirements

WCAG 3 is intended to be **better** than previous versions. It strives to:
* be easier to understand and use
* cover more user needs, including the needs of people with cognitive disabilities
* provide a conformance model that better supports users and organizations (that is, owners/developers of websites, web apps, tools, documents, etc.)

To learn more about the WCAG 3 goals, development process, background, and review questions for the First Public Working Draft, please see the blog post [https://@@ @@title].

## WCAG 3 Name (formerly "Silver" project)

WCAG 3.0 developed from the “Silver” project. It is called “W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0”. This name was chosen because of wide-spread familiarity with the “WCAG” acronym, and to encompass the broader scope beyond “content”.

## Timeline

We expect to publish the First Public Working Draft of WCAG 3.0 in 2020. We expect the final WCAG 3.0 standard to be completed after 2022.

## Who Develops WCAG 3

The WCAG technical documents are developed by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group ([AG WG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/)), the AG WG Silver Task Force, and the Silver Community Group. These Groups are part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org)) Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)).
