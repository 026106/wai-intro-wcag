## Introduction {#intro}

**In January 2021, this page will be updated to introduce the W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 Working Draft.** This page will cover the draft structure and conformance model. It will provide goals, development process, background, and review guiidance.

For now, the following information is available:
* [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) focuses on WCAG 2 versions.
* FAQ: [What about “Silver”?](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/faq/#next) also addresses WCAG 2.2.

## WCAG 3 Name (formerly "Silver" project)

WCAG 3.0 developed from the “Silver” project. It is called “W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0”. This name was chosen because of wide-spread familiarity with the “WCAG” acronym, and to encompass the broader scope beyond “content”.

## Timeline

We expect to publish the First Public Working Draft of WCAG 3.0 in January 2021. We expect the final WCAG 3.0 standard to be completed after 2023.

## Who develops WCAG 3

The WCAG technical documents are developed by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group ([AG WG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/)), the AG WG Silver Task Force, and the Silver Community Group. These Groups are part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org)) Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)).

We welcome your [comments](/standards-guidelines/wcag/commenting/) on the WCAG 3 Working Drafts.
