## Introduction {#intro}

In November 2020, this page will be updated to introduce the W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 Working Draft. It will cover the structure, conformance model, supporting documents, and more.

This page will also link to a blog post with goals, development process, background, and review questions.

For now, the following information is available:
* [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) focuses on WCAG 2 versions.
* FAQ: [What about “Silver”?](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/faq/#next) also addresses WCAG 2.2.

## WCAG 3 Name (formerly "Silver" project)

WCAG 3.0 developed from the “Silver” project. It is called “W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0”. This name was chosen because of wide-spread familiarity with the “WCAG” acronym, and to encompass the broader scope beyond “content”.
