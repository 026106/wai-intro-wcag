## Introduction {#intro}

@@ briefly what WCAG is for newbies that land here only.

WCAG 2 is introduced in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

@@ W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3 is currently an early Working Draft with select bits of information for review.

## WCAG 2 and 3: Different, Similar, Better {#different}

WCAG 3 is **different** from previous versions. It has:
* different structure
* different conformance model
* broader scope, beyond just web content

WCAG 3 is **similar** to previous versions in some ways. It has:
* the same goal of providing guidance on making technology accessible to people with disabilities
* similar fundamental and specific accessibility requirements

WCAG 3 is intended to be **better** than previous versions. It strives to:
* be easier to understand and use
* cover more user needs, including more needs of people with cognitive disabilities
* provide a conformance model that better supports users and organizations _(that is, owners/developers of websites, web apps, tools, documents, etc.)_

_(The rest of this page uses “website” for simplicity, yet WCAG 3 applies much broader than websites.)_

To learn more about the WCAG 3 goals, development process, background, and review questions for the First Public Working Draft, please see the blog post [https://@@]( @@title).

## Conformance Model

@@ summary & explanation of “conformance model”

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" h="4" title="Background Example" class="" %}
{:/}

With WCAG 2, the success criteria is basically pass or fail. If a website does not pass all success criteria at the set level, then the website does not conform to WCAG 2. For example, if one inconsequential image on an unimportant, rarely-visited page is missing alt text, then technically the website as a whole does not pass WCAG 2 Level A. Yet, in this example, that one missing alt has essentially no impact on the accessibility of the website for users. Whereas, missing alt elsewhere on the website could significantly impact accessibility.

The WCAG 3 conformance model is an effort to address situations such as that example &mdash; to benefit users and website providers. Rather than pass-fail, …

## WCAG 3 Name (formerly "Silver" project)

WCAG 3.0 developed from the “Silver” project. It is called “W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0”. This name was chosen because of wide-spread familiarity with the “WCAG” acronym, and to encompass the broader scope beyond “content”.

## Timeline

We expect to publish the First Public Working Draft of WCAG 3.0 in 2020. We expect the final WCAG 3.0 standard to be completed after 2022.

## Who Develops WCAG 3

The WCAG technical documents are developed by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group ([AG WG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/)), the AG WG Silver Task Force, and the Silver Community Group. These Groups are part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org)) Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)).
